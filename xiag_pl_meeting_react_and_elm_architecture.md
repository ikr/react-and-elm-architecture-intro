F˚= C˚•9/5 + 32

I = V/R

r(Θ) = 1 - sin(Θ)

y = x²

While I was speaking, at least 2 new JavaScript frameworks have been released

**React** is a quantum leap

# React

A JavaScript *library* featuring a virtual DOM for rendering HTML

# Elm

Functional programming language for the browser without runtime exceptions

# The awesome

1. GUI as a pure function
  * Utter simplicity
1. Interactivity is still there
  * handling is postponed to next frame

* Unidirectional data flow
* Single source of truth (a-la DB)
* No cascading updates
* No combinatorial explosion of state transitions
* Trivial undo/redo support
* Seamless rendering on both client & server

---

That's the future

So much bigger than JavaScript
